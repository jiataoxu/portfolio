									&emsp;A introductory project to glitching. 
									<i>2024</i> is inspired by announcement of NASA deciding to launch another lunar mission by the year 2024.
									I want to create a poster documenting mankind's achievement in space exploration. The poster includes rocket designs and blueprints from the NASA, Interkosmos (Soviet space agency), and SpaceX.
									Meanwhile, the center-pieces is a rocket that incoprated rocket component from all of these agencies/companies. The first section was inspired by SpaceX's Starship, 
									the center section was inspired by NASA's Saturn V, and the last section was inspired by the Soviet's Soyuz. The united design signifies space exploration being a human achievement.

									from the black artifacts at the bottom third of the image which resemble the letters "PI".

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp;Part of the Collage Glitched Project. The collage was glitched twice. The image was rotated 90 degree before glitching it the second time.
									The result was more abstract compared to the second image; only the texture of the skin remains. 
									One interesting note is that the rotation creates a grid-like artifact (you can see it more clearly in full resolution) akin to what would present out of 
									a cathode-ray tube display.

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp;<i>Human</i> is a variation of the Hyperrealism Collage. It was processed with different layer property. The resulting juxaposition is both
									familiar yet disconnecting. From afar, the image resemble a human face, abeit a little distorted, but at a closer look, the overlapping texture creates a uncanny 
									feeling to it. For this image, I want to create an imagery with something we all familar with and disconnect that familarity through manipluation. I used the hyperrealism drawing because
									it also draws to the same idea of disconnect; despite it realism and attention to detail, it's still a drawing.

										<a href="https://youtu.be/_2im44SbN8M" target="_blank">>> Video Link <<</a>

										The concept is a mean to present a provocate future where rampant capitalism takes over every part of our life with advertising by intergrating adverts into our field of vision. It's a critique to unresricted capitalism.
										Similarity, I want to explore the same concept with this project by using almost disorientating effects and pop-up to re-imagine this grim future.

								&emsp; This weird video was a result of a playful session of brainstroming. The project was inspired that shares the same title and basic
								idea. I was related to that idea that dream often has no meaning to such a extend that I produced my own verison of that meme. I want to express 
								that the idea mythical/super-nature connection of dream and future are absurd and psudo-scientific. I decide to express that absurdity throught
								a silly fun video with heavy artificiality. The video taken on my phone and
								processed with After Effect and Premiere for audio design.

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp; <i>Interactive Randomness powered by Trigonometry</i>, or IRT in short, was created as an assignment for ART 74.
									The idea was to create a tool where with a few interaction, everyone can create their unique computer generated art. 
									As the name suggest, the motion of the geometries is derived from basic Trig. By using randomly generated number as variable, the 
									code can generated varying size of shape at a different speed.
									<br>&emsp; The main goal of this code art is to created a vibrant chaotic yet controlled image. The chaos coming from the randomness and
									viewer interaction, whereas the controlled-ness comes from the limitation of the Trig function: No matter how random the variables are, the final
									shape always ends with a square.
