				&emsp;<i>Dreamer</i> is a digital illustration draw through Clip Studio Paint with a
				tablet incombination with a few re-appropriated old works <br>
				&emsp;The piece was 
				born in a place of confusion. It was created during my second 
				year attending SJSU when I was extremely anxious about my future 
				roadmap. I was unsure what art concentration I wanted to study and 
				questioned whether my current major was the path I want to follow. 
				This piece was a result of that confusion and anxiety, where the 
				colorful unpreditable future contrast with the bleak reality. </div>
