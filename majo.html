				&emsp; <i>魔女</i> (Romaji: majo, English: Witch) is a piece was created during winter break. The pieces
				was heavily influenced by Japanese animation style of drawing (as most of my digital illustrations are inspired
				by Anime). It started as anatomy practice, developed into a charater protrait, and subsquently a part of a world-building
				project. The goal of this pieces is to personificate madness and heresy. Of course, also trying to draw something cute.</div>
