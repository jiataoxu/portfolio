				&emsp; This weird video was a result of a playful session of brainstroming. The project was inspired that shares the same title and basic
				idea. I was related to that idea that dream often has no meaning to such a extend that I produced my own verison of that meme. I want to express 
				that the idea mythical/super-nature connection of dream and future are absurd and psudo-scientific. I decide to express that absurdity throught
				a silly fun video with heavy artificiality. The video taken on my phone and
				processed with After Effect and Premiere for audio design.
