				&emsp; <i>Interactive Randomness powered by Trigonometry</i>, or IRT in short, was created as an assignment for ART 74.
				The idea was to create a tool where with a few interaction, everyone can create their unique computer generated art. 
				As the name suggest, the motion of the geometries is derived from basic Trig. By using randomly generated number as variable, the 
				code can generated varying size of shape at a different speed.
				<br>&emsp; The main goal of this code art is to created a vibrant chaotic yet controlled image. The chaos coming from the randomness and
				viewer interaction, whereas the controlled-ness comes from the limitation of the Trig function: No matter how random the variables are, the final
				shape always ends with a square.
