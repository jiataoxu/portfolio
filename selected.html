								<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
								<br><br>
								&emsp;A introductory project to glitching. 
								<i>2024</i> is inspired by announcement of NASA deciding to launch another lunar mission by the year 2024.
								I want to create a poster documenting mankind's achievement in space exploration. The poster includes rocket designs and blueprints from the NASA, Interkosmos (Soviet space agency), and SpaceX.
								Meanwhile, the center-pieces is a rocket that incoprated rocket component from all of these agencies/companies. The first section was inspired by SpaceX's Starship, 
								the center section was inspired by NASA's Saturn V, and the last section was inspired by the Soviet's Soyuz. The united design signifies space exploration being a human achievement.

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp;<i>魔女</i> (Romaji: majo, English: Witch) is a piece was created during winter break. The pieces
									was heavily influenced by Japanese animation style of drawing (as most of my digital illustrations are inspired
									by Anime). It started as anatomy practice, developed into a charater protrait, and subsquently a part of a world-building
									project. The goal of this pieces is to personificate madness and heresy. Of course, also trying to draw something cute.

								<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
								<br><br>
								&emsp;<i>Human</i> is a variation of the Hyperrealism Collage. It was processed with different layer property. The resulting juxaposition is both
								familiar yet disconnecting. From afar, the image resemble a human face, abeit a little distorted, but at a closer look, the overlapping texture creates a uncanny 
								feeling to it. For this image, I want to create an imagery with something we all familar with and disconnect that familarity through manipluation. I used the hyperrealism drawing because
								it also draws to the same idea of disconnect; despite it realism and attention to detail, it's still a drawing.

								<a href="https://youtu.be/l6ueX5u6mRA" target="_blank">>> Video Link <<</a>
								<br>
								&emsp; This weird video was a result of a playful session of brainstroming. The project was inspired that shares the same title and basic
								idea. I was related to that idea that dream often has no meaning to such a extend that I produced my own verison of that meme. I want to express 
								that the idea mythical/super-nature connection of dream and future are absurd and psudo-scientific. I decide to express that absurdity throught
								a silly fun video with heavy artificiality. The video taken on my phone and
								processed with After Effect and Premiere for audio design.

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp; A self-portrait of the moment. I was dealing with an episode of anxiety attack. I was feeling depressed and powerless. I felt like whatever I had created had no value because I can not find any value in anything.
									I created this work to cope with my depression. The process calm me down, allow me to walk myself out of the mud, and continuing on.

									<a href="https://skfb.ly/6QVTD" target="_blank">>> SketchFab link (Fully interactable 3D model) <<</a>
									<br>
										 &emsp;This 3D sculpture was made in the start of the COVID-19 lockdown. It was created to represent my experience
										of the lockdown. The center-piece of the sculpture was inspired by the popular internet "This is Fine" meme, which depict
										an apathic anthropomorphic dog sitting surround by the fire (<a href = "https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine">https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine</a>).
										During that time, I shared the same sentiment as the dog depicted in the meme: feeling that the world is ending.

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp; <i>Interactive Randomness powered by Trigonometry</i>, or IRT in short, was created as an assignment for ART 74.
									The idea was to create a tool where with a few interaction, everyone can create their unique computer generated art. 
									As the name suggest, the motion of the geometries is derived from basic Trig. By using randomly generated number as variable, the 
									code can generated varying size of shape at a different speed.
									<br>&emsp; The main goal of this code art is to created a vibrant chaotic yet controlled image. The chaos coming from the randomness and
									viewer interaction, whereas the controlled-ness comes from the limitation of the Trig function: No matter how random the variables are, the final
									shape always ends with a square.

									<b>DESCRIPTION</b>:
									<br><br>
									&emsp;This is one of the two-pieces series of glitch art <i>Mushrooms</i>. 
									I create this two pieces Through the use of text- and audiowave-manipluation. The trippy and abstract nature of both images allude to psychedelic effect of Psilocybin (magic mushroom)
									, or in general, the usage of drugs. The original image of the mushroom is appropriated from the net
