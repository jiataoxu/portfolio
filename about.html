				<p>Welcome to my portfolio, I'm Jiatao Xu. I also work under the alias of "Rukul".</p>
				<p>I'm a college student who currently studies in SJSU. My major is Creative Art. I have been drawing and making art since I was young. I'm always motivated to turn my idea into something more physical. Most of the time, I work digitally. My go-to software is Clip Studio Paint. I also work with Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Adobe software.</p>
				<p>My favorite genres to work with are Fantasy and Sci-Fi, and basically, anything that's fictional. I don't prefer non-fictional because I want to be limited by the rules and laws of reality. I'm a big daydreamer.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>You can find me on Github (<a href = "https://github.com/jiataoxu">https://github.com/jiataoxu</a>) and Artstation (<a href = "https://www.artstation.com/rukul">https://www.artstation.com/rukul </a>)
